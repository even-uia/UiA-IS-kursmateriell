    <description>This is an build script. It is interpreted by the program ant.
    To execute this file from a terminal window, cd to the directory that 
    contains this file, and enter the command: ant target, where target is
    one of the targets defined below. You can also execute the targets from
    netbeans, right-click on the project, or on build.xml, and you will
    find the targets as menu entries.
    
    Netbeans uses ant to run the build process, when you ask netbeans to clean,
    compile, deploy etc. netbeans will starts an instance of ant. Unfortunately
    the build files created by netbeans are very complex, and nearly impossible
    to understand.
    
    You should not change this file (unless you make structural changes to
    the project). But you must at least check the property files, and
    probably edit platform.properties, to set up the project for your
    computer</description>

    <!-- Load properties
         The property files that are loaded here contains variuos settings
         for the project. The comments in each file describe the contents
         to use a property, enclose it's name like this: ${name}   -->
